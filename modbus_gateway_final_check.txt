DS1101 -- there shouldn't be a "serial interface" setting in Serial tabs

Do we actually support TPS3? I don't see the arrangement where ALL serial tibbits can be #02

In the web interface, the order of serial options for TPS is different from the DS Man

How come in DS Man we have different option sets for ports 1/3 and 2/4, but in the web interface it is all the same?

Why do we have max intercharacter delay?

We do not need TCP port in port-based routing settings
