DS1101 -- there shouldn't be a "serial interface" setting in Serial tabs

TPS2: In the web interface, the order of serial options for TPS is different from the DS Man

TPS2: How come in DS Man we have different option sets for ports 1/3 and 2/4, but in the web interface it is all the same?


TPS3 has "number of serial ports in use." Why doesn't TPS2 have this?

Why we specify Tibbits in TPS2 but not in TPS3?


Why do we have max intercharacter delay?

We do not need TCP port in port-based routing settings
